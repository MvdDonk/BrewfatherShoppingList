# Icon Placeholder Files

The extension requires icon files in the following sizes:
- icon-16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon-32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon-48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon-128.png (128x128 pixels)

These should be beer/brewing themed icons (like a beer mug, hop, or grain).

You can create these using any image editor or find suitable icons from:
- Font Awesome (free icons)
- Material Design Icons
- Or create custom icons

For now, you can use simple beer emoji or brewing-related symbols as placeholders until proper icons are created.
