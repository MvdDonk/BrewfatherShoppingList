# Brewfather Shopping List Extension - Complete Context Document

**Date Created**: August 31, 2025  
**Project**: Microsoft Edge Browser Extension for Brewfather Recipe Shopping Lists  
**Status**: Implemented and Ready for Testing

## 📋 Project Overview

This document contains all the context, decisions, and implementation details for the Brewfather Shopping List browser extension. This is intended for future AI assistants working on this project.

### Purpose
Create a Microsoft Edge browser extension that allows users to generate shopping lists from Brewfather brewing recipes by integrating with the Brewfather API.

### Key Requirements Fulfilled
1. ✅ Detect when user is on Brewfather recipe pages
2. ✅ Inject "Add to Shopping List" button on recipe pages
3. ✅ Fetch recipe data using Brewfather API v2
4. ✅ Extract and aggregate ingredients (fermentables, hops, yeasts)
5. ✅ Store shopping list persistently
6. ✅ Provide export functionality (Text, CSV, PDF)
7. ✅ Secure credential management

## 🏗️ Architecture & Technical Decisions

### Browser Extension Structure (Manifest V3)
- **Content Script**: Detects recipe pages and injects UI button
- **Background Service Worker**: Handles API calls and data management
- **Popup Interface**: Displays shopping list and management tools
- **Options Page**: Configuration for API credentials

### Key Technical Decisions Made

#### 1. Ingredient Uniqueness Strategy
- **Decision**: Use `_id` field from Brewfather recipe JSON for ingredient uniqueness
- **Rationale**: Same ingredient from different suppliers should be treated as different items
- **Implementation**: Ingredients with same `_id` get quantities aggregated across recipes

#### 2. API Integration Approach
- **Endpoint Used**: `https://api.brewfather.app/v2/recipes/:id`
- **Authentication**: HTTP Basic Auth with base64-encoded `userid:apikey`
- **Rate Limiting**: 500 calls per hour per API key (handled with proper error messages)

#### 3. Ingredient Processing Rules
Based on actual Brewfather recipe JSON structure:

**Fermentables** (`recipe.fermentables[]`):
- Amount unit: `kg` (kilograms)
- Unique by: `_id` field
- Additional data: `name`, `type`, `origin`, `supplier`, `color`, `potential`

**Hops** (`recipe.hops[]`):
- Amount unit: `g` (grams)
- Unique by: `_id` field
- **Special handling**: Same hop used multiple times in recipe gets aggregated
- Additional data: `name`, `alpha`, `type`, `origin`, `use`, `time`

**Yeasts** (`recipe.yeasts[]`):
- Amount unit: From `unit` field (typically "pkg")
- Unique by: `_id` field
- Additional data: `name`, `laboratory`, `type`, `form`, `attenuation`

**Excluded**: `recipe.miscs[]` (per user request)

#### 4. Data Storage Strategy
- **Credentials**: Chrome sync storage (encrypted, syncs across devices)
- **Shopping Lists**: Chrome local storage (device-specific)
- **Storage Keys**: Defined in background.js STORAGE_KEYS constant

### User Modifications Made
The user made manual edits to several files after initial implementation. Key changes observed:

**popup.js**:
- Modified the initialization flow in `initializePopup()` function
- Moved `setupEventListeners()` call to always execute, even when credentials missing
- **NEW**: Added main menu interface with three options
- **NEW**: Added auto-navigation to shopping list after adding recipes
- **NEW**: Added popup state management with local storage flags

**content.js**:
- Modified button injection selectors to include `'body'` as first option
- **UPDATED**: Now injects button inside `ion-title` element for inline positioning
- **NEW**: Triggers shopping list display after successful recipe addition

**content.css**:
- Added `position: absolute` and `top: 5px` to button positioning (later changed)
- **UPDATED**: Changed to inline-block positioning to stick next to title text
- **NEW**: Added relative positioning for ion-toolbar/ion-header containers

**background.js**:
- **NEW**: Added tab event monitoring for URL changes
- **NEW**: Added popup state management with storage flags
- **NEW**: Added showShoppingList message handler

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Recipe Page Detection
- **URL Pattern**: `/tabs/recipes/recipe/[recipe-id]`
- **Regex Used**: `/\/tabs\/recipes\/recipe\/([^\/]+)/`
- **Button Injection**: Injects inside `ion-title` element for inline positioning

### Extension Popup Interface
- **Main Menu**: Three options when clicking extension icon:
  1. **Add to Shopping List**: Adds current recipe (if on recipe page)
  2. **Show Shopping List**: View and manage shopping list
  3. **Settings**: Configure API credentials
- **Auto-Navigation**: After adding recipe, automatically shows shopping list
- **State Management**: Uses local storage flag to control popup behavior

### API Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling for:
- 401: Invalid credentials
- 403: Insufficient API scope permissions
- 404: Recipe not found
- 429: Rate limit exceeded
- Network errors
- Malformed responses

### Shopping List Features
- **Grouping**: Ingredients grouped by type (Fermentables, Hops, Yeasts)
- **Aggregation**: Same `_id` ingredients combined across recipes
- **Recipe Tracking**: Each ingredient tracks source recipes
- **Export Formats**:
  - Text: Human-readable with sections
  - CSV: Spreadsheet compatible
  - PDF: Browser print functionality

### Security Considerations
- Credentials stored in Chrome's encrypted sync storage
- No third-party data transmission (only to Brewfather API)
- Content Security Policy compliant
- No eval() or unsafe inline scripts

## 📊 Data Flow

### Adding Recipe to Shopping List
1. User clicks "Add to Shopping List" button on recipe page
2. Content script extracts recipe ID from URL
3. Background script fetches recipe from Brewfather API
4. Recipe JSON parsed to extract ingredients
5. Ingredients processed and aggregated with existing shopping list
6. Updated shopping list saved to local storage
7. Success feedback shown to user

### Shopping List Management
1. Popup opens and checks for credentials
2. If configured, loads shopping list from local storage
3. Displays grouped and formatted ingredients
4. Allows individual item removal or bulk clear
5. Export functionality generates formatted output

## 🔑 Configuration Requirements

### Brewfather API Setup
Users must obtain from Brewfather settings:
1. **User ID**: Found in Brewfather Settings → API section
2. **API Key**: Generated in Brewfather Settings → API section
3. **Required Scope**: "Read Recipes" must be enabled

### Extension Installation
1. Load as unpacked extension in Edge developer mode
2. Configure credentials in extension options
3. Test connection to verify setup

## 🐛 Known Issues & Considerations

### Potential Issues
1. **Button Injection**: Brewfather's SPA navigation might require button re-injection
2. **Rate Limiting**: Users with many recipes might hit 500/hour limit
3. **Recipe Changes**: Updated recipes won't automatically update shopping list
4. **Icon Files**: Placeholder icons need replacement with proper brewing-themed icons

### Browser Compatibility
- **Primary Target**: Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based)
- **Compatibility**: Should work in Chrome/Brave with minimal changes
- **Manifest Version**: Uses V3 (required for new extensions)

## 📈 Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Requested Features
1. ✅ Text export
2. ✅ CSV export  
3. ✅ PDF export (implemented via print)

### Potential Enhancements
1. Recipe scaling functionality (e.g., double batch)
2. Unit conversion (metric to imperial)
3. Integration with brewing supply stores
4. Inventory tracking integration
5. Multiple shopping list support
6. Shopping list sharing functionality

## 🔗 API Reference

### Brewfather API v2 Documentation
